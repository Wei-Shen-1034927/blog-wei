* Personal Identity Statement

While I was at Lincoln library, working on my COMP637 final assesment. I asked ChatGPT to help me craft a personal identity statement. 

```
I grew up in China during the 1980s, in a time of change, uncertainty, and emerging opportunity. In 1995, I moved to New Zealand, where I completed my university degree and began building a new life. Later, I returned to China and spent ten years working, gaining life experience that taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of perspective.

I am now a father of two, and at 45, I’m entering a new chapter — one that requires courage and humility. I am working to transition into the IT industry, even though I have no formal background in technology. I understand the steep learning curve ahead, but I also know that I’ve overcome far more challenging transitions in the past.

This journey is not just about changing careers — it’s about proving to myself that it’s never too late to start over, to grow, and to be of value in a rapidly evolving world. I want to be productive, to contribute meaningfully to a team, and to continue learning as long as I can.

I know I carry self-doubt, but I also bring empathy, creativity, and a quiet strength that’s been shaped by decades of real-world experience. At the heart of it all, I am guided by integrity, honesty, growth, and freedom — values that help me navigate forward even when the path feels uncertain.
