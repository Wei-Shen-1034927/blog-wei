# Some 693 Reflections

I am learning a lot through 693:
- Git
- CSS
- JavaScript
- and creating a blog in Github 

This is all good, but it felt random and unorganized, too little and too late. The task of mastering any of the above skills felt daunting. I enjoy the feeling of getting better at something. Like skiing from last season and mountain biking from this year, the process of getting better is slow and painful.  It is going to take a while before I can get the hang of these skills. I need patience, but I am also 44 years old.
