# My 693 Final Report submission is 5 seconds late

I can't believe how stupid I was. At 11:55, I have already submitted my final report and everything is fine. But somehow I decided to change a few sentences and tried to submit it again. By the time the file is uploaded and I clicked save submission again. It went over time!

**Why do I have to do the second submission**
